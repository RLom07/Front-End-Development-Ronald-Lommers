                        <p>Use building blocks called nodes to create more complex and reusable scenes. Add scripts to your scenes and customize
                        built-in behavior to implement your unique game mechanics. Rely on composition and node hierarchy to make game logic
                        clear at a glance.</p>

                        <p>Make your scenes into full-featured components, with tools for your designers to tweak and adjust the look and function.
                        Share your components with the community of like-minded developers as addons and templates.</p>

                        <p>Define scriptable objects called resources to describe characters, entities, and data structures in your game. Use your
                        custom objects directly in the editor by assigning them to nodes. Resources come with a high-level API to store and read
                        them, and they support every Godot type, including other resources.</p>

                        <p>Get things done quickly with Godot's built-in scripting language GDScript. Inspired by Python and other languages, it is
                        easy to pick up even if you are a beginner. Tight engine integration allows it to express game logic in a clear and
                        natural form.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>New in 4.0:</strong> GDScript offers optional static typing support, boosting your coding efficiency and runtime performance.
                        Powerful language features and first-class functions allow for expressive yet concise code.</p>

                        familiar libraries and give them a performance boost, while still benefiting from close engine integration.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> .NET support is provided as a dedicated engine executable. <a href="#">C# support is available for desktop and mobile
                        platforms as of Godot 4.2.</a> Web support should be added in the future, but until then, <a href="#">Godot 3</a> remains a supported
                        option.

                        <p>Godot is built to be extended, and that means you can choose a programming language not provided by the Godot team
                        itself. Thanks to our community there are many language bindings for popular tools like Rust, Nim, Python, and
                        JavaScript.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>New in 4.0:</strong> C++ supports comes officially in the form of GDExtension API, which gives you a way to script and program
                        your game components for maximum performance without having to recompile the engine.

                        <p>Thanks to the modular structure and a straightforward build process of Godot you can create your own engine modules.
                        Gain every last drop of performance or integrate with many third-party libraries with low-level C++ code.
